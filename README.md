# Chrome Extensions Privacy Policy

_Effective Date: September 26, 2024_

I respect and value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how I handle and protect your personal information in relation to your use of my Google Chrome extension(s).

## Information Collection

My Google Chrome Extensions do not collect any personal information from users. I do not gather, store, or transmit any data that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, email address, or location. Since no data is collected, none of your data is sold to third parties.

## Links to Other Websites

My Google Chrome Extensions may contain links to other websites not operated by me. This Privacy Policy does not cover how that website processes personal information. I encourage you to review the Privacy Policy of every website that you visit.

## Third Party APIs

My Google Chrome extensions may access third party APIs and report back the results. Generally, when my extensions use these third Party API services, they will send some non-personal information about the page you are visiting. However, when extensions access a third party API, there is some personal information that third party receives in the request header, most notably your IP address and user agent string. Some companies will use information like that to develop a â€œbrowser fingerprint" that can probably track and personally identify you. Unfortunately, this is not something that I or my extensions have control over. If this is a concern for you, consider using a VPN to mask your IP address.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised Privacy Policy, and the "Effective Date" above will be updated. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

By using my Google Chrome Extensions, you signify your consent and agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please refrain from using my Google Chrome Extensions.

## Feedback

If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, you can contact me by [email](mailto:klof4four@gmail.com).
